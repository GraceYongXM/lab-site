      <description>&lt;p&gt;Basic cognitive processes (e.g., attention and executive functioning) regulate what information from the environment enters conscious processing and how well that information can be processed and utilized or discarded. When these processes go awry, particularly in the context of negatively-valenced information or stimuli, they may lead to negative mood states and factors associated with depression risk and depression severity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We were the first group to show that while identical twins discordant for depression show no differences in neuropsychological functioning, they exhibit attentional impairment relative to identical twins with no family history of depression. These results suggest the attentional impairments observed in depression are not associated with depression state or history as previously hypothesized and assumed, but rather familial risk for depression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

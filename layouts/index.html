          Anxiety and depression profoundly affect individuals by influencing
          their thoughts, emotions, and behaviours. They often coexist, creating
          a compounded burden that disrupts personal relationships, work, and
          overall well-being. While these conditions are common, each personâ€™s
          experience is unique, shaped by a combination of biological,
          psychological, and environmental factors.

          At the Clinical Translational Science Lab, we strive to untangle this
          complexity by investigating the core processes that drive anxiety and
          depression. This includes exploring how individuals respond to stress,
          how negative thought patterns develop, and how these conditions alter
          cognitive and emotional regulation. Our research emphasises a nuanced
          understanding of these disorders to pave the way for more targeted and
          effective interventions.

          Ultimately, our lab seeks to bridge research and practice, translating
          findings into actionable strategies for treatment and prevention.
          Through a deeper understanding of anxiety and depression, we hope to
          improve mental health outcomes and enhance resilience in those
          affected.

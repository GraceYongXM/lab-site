  - name: PL3106 Mental Health and Distress
    nusmodLink: https://nusmods.com/courses/PL3106/mental-health-and-distress
    description:
      This core course covers most of the common mental health problems
      identified for children and adults, e.g. eating disorders, behavioural
      problems, attention deficits, learning disabilities, schizophrenia,
      anxiety, stress, depression, personality disorders, sexual adjustment,
      substance abuse, suicide, and dementia. The lectures and discussion groups provide an introduction to clinical intervention, but emphasis is placed on the theoretical formulation of problems. Whenever possible, films and case studies are used to supplement the textbook and readings, and a visit to the local Institute of Mental Health will usually be arranged.
  - name: PL3287B Lab in Clinical Translational Science
    nusmodLink: https://nusmods.com/courses/PL3287B/lab-in-clinical-translational-science
    description: This course will introduce students interested in clinical psychology to methods in experimental psychopathology, drawing upon the National Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Criteria ((RDoC) framework. The RDoC framework offers a modern, transdiagnostic way of thinking about mental health challenges and breaking even symptoms down into their constituent processes. Particular domains of emphasis will include cognitive processes for emotional and non-emotional information and reward-related functioning in clinical psychology. Students will work in small groups to design and conduct an experiment using these methodologies and submit individual research reports. Prior background and interest in clinical psychology will be very helpful.
